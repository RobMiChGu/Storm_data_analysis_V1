#Introduction

Severe storms and other weather events can cause significant health and economic impacts to communities and municipalities. Many severe events can lead to fatalities, injuries, and property damage, and it is a major concern to mitigate these consequences as much as possible.

The dataset used for this project is the Storm Database of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). This database tracks the characteristics of severe storms and weather events in the United States, including when and where they occur, as well as estimates of fatalities, injuries, and property damage.

The purpose of this project is to analyze the NOAA Storm Database to identify trends and patterns in severe weather events in the United States. The analysis will focus on the following questions:

What are the most common types of severe weather events in the United States?
Where do severe weather events occur most frequently?
What are the most significant health and economic impacts of severe weather events?
The analysis will use a variety of statistical methods to answer these questions. The results of the analysis will be presented in a report that includes a discussion of the findings, as well as implications for public policy and decision-making.
